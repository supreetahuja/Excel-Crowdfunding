To determine which group, successful or failed backers, has more variability in their Crowdfunding campaigns, we can compare the standard deviation of both datasets.

For the Successful backers:
Standard Deviation: 1267

For the Failed backers:
Standard Deviation: 961

Comparing these standard deviation values, we can observe the following:

The standard deviation measures the spread or variability of the data points around the mean. A larger standard deviation indicates a greater variability in the data. In this case, the standard deviation of successful backers (1267) is larger than that of failed backers (961).

Therefore, based on the standard deviation values, we can conclude that there is more variability in the campaigns of Successful backers compared to Failed backers.

This result makes sense because successful crowdfunding campaigns typically involve a wider range of funding amounts, with some campaigns receiving exceptionally high contributions. This leads to a larger spread of values and a higher standard deviation in the dataset of successful backers. On the other hand, failed campaigns tend to have more consistent and lower funding amounts, resulting in a smaller spread of values and a lower standard deviation in the dataset of failed backers.

Hence, the higher standard deviation of the successful backers' dataset indicates a greater variability in the funding amounts, supporting the idea that Successful campaigns exhibit more variability compared to Failed campaigns.
